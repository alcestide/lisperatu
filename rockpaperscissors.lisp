;; At the time of writing (14/01/2023), this code only supports a PC vs CPU gamemode.
;; Multi-player mode will probably be implemented in the future.
;; Run (load "rockpaperscissors.lisp") inside a Lisp interpreter such as SBCL or CLISP
;; and follow the instructions. This simple lisp implementation allows replayability.
